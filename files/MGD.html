<h2 id="introduction">1.  Introduction to Chinese folk songs </h2>

For details, please refer to <a href="http://en.chinaculture.org/library/2008-01/11/content_71371.htm">China Culture Website</a>.

<h3 id="History">1.1  History of Chinese folk songs </h2>
<p>
    Folk song is the longest history, simplest structure, richest numbers, and widest spreading music genre among Chinese traditional culture. 
    The earliest Chinese poetry anthology, <i>Book of Songs</i> , appeared 3000 years ago. 
    The 305 poems collected in the anthology are divided into three categories, 
    <i>Feng</i> (local folk songs), <i>Ya</i> and <i>Song</i> (court songs, banquet songs, flattering praises, and sacrificial pomes), 
    which display the music for folk customs, court and ritual of the pre-Qin period (before 211 B.C.E). 

    <i>Tan Ge</i> (弹歌) recorded in <i>The History of Wu Kingdom and Yue Kingdom</i> (吴越春秋)is still popular among farmers of Jiangsu Province, 
    and there are some ancient songs and secular songs of the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing (1616-1911) Dynasties transmitted from generations to generations in different regions.

<h3 id="Taxonomy">1.2  Taxonomy </h2>

<p>
    The folk songs of the Han people, which accounts for above 90% of China’s population,
    fall into nine categories according to music genres as <i>haozi</i> (work songs, 号子), <i>shan’ge</i> (mountain songs, 山歌), 
    <i>tian’ge</i> (field songs, 田歌), <i>xiao diao</i> (small tunes, 小调), <i>wu’ge</i> (dance songs, 舞歌), <i>yu’ge</i> (fisherman’s songs, 渔歌), 
    ritual songs, children’s songs, vendors’ cries (生活音调). 
</p>

<p>
    The ethnic minorities in China all have their work songs, mountain songs, dance songs, ritual songs (礼俗歌), and children’s songs. 
    Besides, love songs (情歌), narrative songs (叙事歌), and religious songs are all highly important.

<p>
    <i>Haozi</i> (Work songs) has a long history. They appeared and were sung in labor;

    forest work songs in northeast China, and rice-seedling transplanting work songs in Jiangsu and Zhejiang.

</p>


<p>
    Work songs of the minorities are classified by ways of working. For instance,

    <i>Flailing Song</i> (打连枷) and <i>Ox-Driving Songs</i> (牛佬佬调) of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qiang_people">Qiang</a> ethnic group in grain threshing.
